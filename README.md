# Face Fitting

Little project in python based on project from Patrick Hubber (https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos). Idea is to fit a morphable model (the basel face model) to face image, given keypoints in the image and in the face model. The project is still in its very beginning. 

## Requirements

* Python 3.5, with some standard libraries (numpy, opencv 3...)
* Basel Face Model (possibly the .mat file)
* Image with keypoint file. I will provide one.
